## 🎵 Playing the Piano

I started learning piano as a child and find it relaxing and expressive. I often play classical and movie soundtracks.

## 📸 Photography

Capturing natural light and candid moments has always fascinated me. I'm especially drawn to cityscapes and street photography.

## 🚴‍♀️ Cycling

I enjoy long bike rides in the countryside. It keeps me fit and helps me clear my mind after a long day of studying.
